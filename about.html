                    <p> Our journey began during the challenging times of the pandemic when access to supermarkets became limited and our previous businesses faced obstacles. In the midst of these circumstances, we recognized an opportunity to serve our community by providing a diverse range of ingredients that were scarce, particularly Japanese and Korean products. 
                        Drawing upon our extensive connections within the culinary world, which we cultivated through our relationships with chefs and bakers, we set out to bridge the gap and meet the demand for these specialty ingredients. Leveraging our privilege as owners of a medical supply store, we navigated through checkpoints to deliver essential medical supplies across the country. Along the way, we seized the chance to visit Japanese and Korean stores in Manila, sourcing authentic and high-quality products to bring back to Laguna.</p>
